// The code style shown in project videos and assignments throughout the rest of the course is different from what we've used so far. The videos were made prior to our updating to ES6. As such, we opted to have code be in sync with the videos to avoide confusion. Additionally, there are also personal choices from the instructor in the video. We'll highlight some of the instructor's personal choices here, but ask that you follow the style guide from the Computational Thinking and JavaScript Programming course in your code.
