### Using Postman

You can think of Postman as a specialized web browser that allows a little more manual control and has more buttons and switches as a result.



#### JSON format

- A way to represent data that was derived from the JavaScript language. This format is commonly used when formatting data for consumption by other computers as it has a very well defined structure and is widly supported by both servers and clients.

### Defining API

#### What is an API?

- An API, or Application Programming Interface, provides a way for computer systems to interact with each other.
- While the types of uses for APIs are vast, the one thing all APIs have in common is providing functionality for use by another program.

#### Web APIs

- They operate over HTTP

#### Provider and Consumer

- An API provider is the system that provides an API for other parties to use. GitHub is the prover of the GitBub API, and dropbox is the provider of the Dropbox API.
- An API consumer is the system that uses the API to acomplish some work. When you check the weather on your phone, it is running a program that is consuming a weather API to retrieve forcast data.

#### Enabling Automation

- APIs allow users of a service to make use of it in new and useful ways.

#### Leverage Existing Services

- Even fairly simple sites will need to process credit card payments, send emails, fetch information about books, or call cell phones and read messages to the recipient. While it is possible to write all of the code to perform these tasks oneself, it usually doesn't make sense to, especially for smaller companies with basic needs.
- APIs enable application developers to build their applications on top of a variety of other specailzed systems, allowing them to focus on their actual objectives and not worry about all the complexities of every part of the system.

## A Review of HTTP

- URLs descibe what resource is being targeted
- HTTP defines how systems send messages about these resources, and data formats allow these messages to be converted into data that is then acted on.

#### Request and Response

- Web APIs are based on the same technologies that allow websites, web browsers, and web servers to work: HTTP.
- HTTP or Hypertext Transfer Protocol describes how a client program (such as a web browser) interacts with servers. These interactions are based on a request-response pattern, where the client asks the server for something it wants (the request) and the server then sends something back (the response).





It looks like markitondemand is depreciated: https://github.com/markitondemand/DEPRECATED-DataApis

So the example in the Web APIs book doesn't work anymore.

Instead, to get stock data, you can use IEXCloud, but you just need to sign up for a free account and get a publishable token: https://iexcloud.io/

Once you get your token, the HTTP request would look like this:
`http https://cloud.iexapis.com/v1/stock/tsla/book\?token\=pk_79c9df6b8ded4c828a855cd5bac33d32`



#### Summary

- Web APIs are built on top of HTTP, the technology that makes the web work.
- HTTP Responses have 3 main parts: status code, headers, and body.
- The Content-Type header describes the format of the response body.

## A Review of URLs

- URI, or uniform resource identifier, is a name used to identify a resource. The resources represented by URIs can be anywhere.
- URL, or uniform resource locator, is the location where a resource can be found.
- When it comes to deciding to use URI or URL, the thing to remember is this: if you are working with resources on the internet, just use URL.

#### Summary

- Working with web APIs involves working with URLs
- URLs represent where a resource is and how it can be accessed.
- URLs typically contain a protocol, hostname, path, and sometimes a query string.
- Paths (and URLs) can include placeholders when they are written generically.
