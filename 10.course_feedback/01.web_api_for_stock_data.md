In the Launch School Web APIs book: https://launchschool.com/books/working_with_apis/read/a_review_of_http

It looks like the example they used to pull down stock data using `markitondemand` is depreciated:
https://github.com/markitondemand/DEPRECATED-DataApis

So the example in the Web APIs book doesn't work anymore:
`http dev.markitondemand.com/MODApis/Api/v2/Quote/json?symbol=TSLA --json`

However, you can use IEXCloud, but you just need to sign up for a free account and get a publishable token: https://iexcloud.io/

Once you get your token, the HTTP request would look like this:
`http https://cloud.iexapis.com/v1/stock/tsla/book\?token\=pk_79c9df6b8ded4c828a855cd5bac33d32`
