// How does JavaScript even work?

// A single threaded non-blocking asynchronous concurrent language
// Javascript has a call stack, an event loop, a callback queue and other APIs.

// The heap is where memory allocation happens


// Single threaded runtime means it can run one piece of code at a time.

// Concurrency and the Event Loop. One thing at a time, except not really.

// The browser is more than just the runtime.
